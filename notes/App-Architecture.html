<h1><strong>Android App Architecture</strong></h1>

<p>The architecture of an Android app differs from desktop application architecture.
App architecture is based upon <em>components</em> that communicate with each other by
using <em>intents</em> that are described by a <em>manifest</em> and that are stored in an app
package.</p>

<h2>  <strong>Components</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><em>activities</em></li>
<li><em>services</em></li>
<li><em>content providers</em></li>
<li><em>broadcast receivers</em></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>An app is a collection of <em>components</em> that run in a Linux process and
are managed by Android.</p></blockquote>

<h4>These components share a set of resources, including:</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>databases</em></li>
<li><em>preferences</em></li>
<li><em>filesystem</em></li>
<li><em>Linux process</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Component reuse reduces overall memory footprint, which is very important
for devices with limited memory.</p>

<h4><strong>When Needed</strong> Only</h4>

<blockquote><p> Android starts a process when any part of the app is needed, such as the
 reusable shared components, and instantiates the <code>Java objects</code> for that
 part.
 This is why Android&rsquo;s apps don&rsquo;t have a single entry point, e.g. C-style
 <code>main()</code> function.</p></blockquote>

<h2>  <strong><em>Activities</em></strong></h2>

<p>An <em>activity</em> is a component that presents a user interface so that the user can
interact with an app.</p>

<h2>|   Application     |   Activity    |</h2>

<p>|   Contacts        |   New Contact |
|   Phone           |   Dial Number |
|   Calculator      |   Calculate   |
|   Calculator      |   Advanced panel |</p>
